===================
TODO List for Jinja
===================

1.1:

    - Improve the context lookup (maybe with an optional C extension) [DONE]
    - make Undefined exchangeable [DONE]
    - implement block.super [DONE]
    - Implement a `IntrospectionPrinter` that works like pprint but it outputs
      either plain text or html. It would also have to cover changing names of
      the special builtins True, False etc to lowercase in order to not
      confuse people.
    - decide on `{% call %}`
    - speed up jinja import
    - add optional zlib compression of template bytecode
    - write more unittests!!!!
    - release it and update this todo list

1.2:

    - `include` and `extends` should work with dynamic data too. In order to
      support this the blocks should be stored as importable functions in the
      generated source.
    - add support for `{% include myfile = 'myfile.html' %}` and give the
      template designer to access variables and macros defined in the template
      root or requirements namespace.
